# Match Stranded
Match Starnded is a game that I developed to try out my Game Engine (Ovis Engine). The origin of this project comes from a job interview that I had where I was given a case which I had to developed a Match2 game. I developed the case in Unity and it succeded, nevertheless I got eliminated in the final round of the hiring process. 

I am learning valuable insights during recruitment processes and becoming more aware of my areas for improvement. With the knowledge I gain, I always roll up my sleeves to take myself to the next level. This projectâ€™s main purpose is exactly that. I completed the given case in Unity and have been developing games using Unity for a long time, but for me, the next step was to improve my technical skills and learn coding principles in a large project. So, I decided to take on the challenge of implementing this case from scratch using my own game engine.
